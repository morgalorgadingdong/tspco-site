									<h2>FAQ</h2>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: Are you accepting new clients?</p>
										<p>A: Yes! We are accepting new clients from birth - 21 years of age. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: What if I am unsure if my child needs therapy services or an evaluation?</p>
										<p>A: Consider speaking to one of our speech-language pathologists (SLP) during a free consultation. A free consultation consists of a 10-15 minute phone call where you can talk with one of our therapists about your concerns without committing to a full evaluation. During the consultation, an SLP will ask questions about your child’s development, address any concerns you may have, and provide recommendations for your child. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: Where do you treat?</p>
										<p>A: We are unique because we offer in-home services to children in Central Oregon. Communities we currently serve are Bend, Redmond, Prineville, Terrebonne, Sisters, and Madras. Our telehealth services are available to families that live in Oregon and California. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: Do you take insurance? </p>
										<p>A: Currently we are private pay only and payment is due at the time of services. We can provide you with an invoice as well as documentation of services and you can contact your insurance company to see if they will reimburse you for services. We may become in-network providers with a few insurance companies in the future. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: What ages do you see?</p>
										<p>A: We provide pediatric services for children from birth to 21. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: My child receives speech therapy at school, can they also get speech therapy at The Speech Path?</p>
										<p>A: Yes! Additional therapy sessions can help children meet their goals without pulling them out of class. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: My child did not qualify for speech therapy at school but I still think they need it, can they see you? </p>
										<p>A: Yes! Schools are bound by state laws for qualifying children for services as well as show an educational need. Not all children who could benefit from SLP services may qualify. We will conduct our own assessment to determine if private speech therapy is appropriate for your child. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: Do you work with children with autism? How about AAC devices?</p>
										<p>A: Yes. Collaboration and treatment of children with autism as well as children with AAC devices/supports and working closely with their families and support systems is one of our specialties.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: Do you involve parents in the therapy process?</p>
										<p>A: Yes. Parents are often invited to take part and/or observe. Each session allows time for the SLP and the parent to discuss progress as well as specifics about the therapy session. Home programs are provided to the parent to increase carryover. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p class="mb-1 bold">Q: Do you have another question?</p>
										<p>A: Please contact us at info@cospeechpath.co</p>
